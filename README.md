# cpp-web-servers - A C++ Version of the [rust-lang web servers guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html)
A simple guide to multithreaded web servers in C++!

This repository contains C++ code snippets that are derived from the [rust-lang web servers guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).

This repository is the result of me following along from this rust guide, but implementing the web servers in C++ instead. I thought I'd leave these markdown files up in case it they help anyone else.

Just like the original guide, this one is also split into two major parts:
- 1) [We build a Single-Threaded Web Server](/src/single-thread-server/single_thread_server_guide.md)
- 2) [We turn our Single-Threaded Server into a Multithreaded Server](src/multithread-server/multithread_server_guide.md)
